The source end system first transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the first router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the second router receives the bit; and so on. Thus our bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium.|2024-09-02 11:07:15|2024-09-02 11:17:39|2024-09-02 11:17:59|2024-09-02 11:18:36
As shown in this figure, a socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API)|2024-09-02 11:07:15|2024-09-02 11:17:39|2024-09-02 11:17:59|2024-09-02 11:18:36

The session layer provides for delimiting and synchronization of data exchange, including the means to build a checkpointing and recovery scheme.|2024-09-02 11:17:39|2024-09-02 11:17:59|2024-09-02 11:18:36
A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket.|2024-09-02 11:17:59|2024-09-02 11:18:36
In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end|2024-09-02 11:17:59|2024-09-02 11:18:36
Note that π∗ has the interesting property that it is the optimal policy for all states s.Specifcally, it is not the case that if we were starting in some state s then there’d be some optimal policy for that state, and if we were starting in some other state s0 then there’d be some other policy that’s optimal policy for s0. The same policy π∗ attains the maximum in Equation (15.1) for all states s. This means that we can use the same policy π∗ no matter what the initial state of our MDP is.|2024-09-02 11:18:36
design alleviates the vanishing gradient problem, resulting in models that are much easier to train, especially when facing datasets with long sequence lengths.|2024-09-02 11:18:36
